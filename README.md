## Hi 👋 I'm Mehmet Eren

**Software Engineer |**  

 Hello, I am Mehmet Eren. I graduated from Selçuk University Computer Engineering in May 2025. I have focused on microservice architecture, N-Tier
 Architecture and artificial intelligence based systems and I have developed and continue to develop myself in these areas. I do backend development
 with C# and ASP.NET Core; I use technologies such as RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB and MsSQL effectively in data
 management and messaging processes. I use RESTful API standards for inter-service communication and deploy my projects through Docker
 containers. I have also developed various projects in the fields of deep learning and machine learning. I had the opportunity to present one of these
 projects at an international conference.
